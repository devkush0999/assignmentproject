## Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** blog posts
- **JWT Authentication** to manage user sessions securely
- **Context API** for global state management
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (using `tailwind-rn` for React Native)
- **Responsive** and **User-Friendly** design

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the app up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) installed globally

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blog-app.git
cd blog-app
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies for both the client (React Native app) and the backend server.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install tailwind dependencies
npm install tailwind-rn
npx tailwind-rn init
```

> **Note:** `tailwind-rn` requires a `tailwind.config.js` file to be set up and initialized with `npx tailwind-rn init`. This generates a `tailwind.json` file for Tailwind utility styles.

### Step 3: Set Up the Backend

Youâ€™ll need to have the backend server running for the app to work. If you haven't already, create a simple backend server (like the one mentioned above) with endpoints for login, registration, and CRUD operations for blog posts.

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create an `.env` file in the project root and add the backend server URL.

```env
API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

### Step 5: Run the App

Run the Expo development server:

```bash
expo start
```

You can scan the QR code in the Expo Go app on your mobile device or use an Android/iOS emulator to test the app.

## Usage

### Logging In

1. On the login screen, enter your username and password (use dummy credentials set up in your backend).
2. On successful login, the app saves the token for accessing protected routes.

### Creating and Viewing Blog Posts

1. After logging in, navigate to the blog posts screen.
2. You can view a list of posts, click on any post to see details, and use the form to add new posts.
3. Each post can be edited or deleted by clicking the respective buttons.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: For building the mobile app.
- **Expo**: For fast development and testing.
- **Context API**: For global state management.
- **Tailwind CSS** (via `tailwind-rn`): For styling in React Native.
